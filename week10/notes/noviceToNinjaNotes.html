      <h3>Form Validation</h3>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The 3 reasons for form validation: 1.We want to get the right data, in
        the right format. Our applications won't work properly if our users'
        data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted
        altogether. 2. We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to
        enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account
        information. 3. We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that
        malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application.
        See Website security.<br /><br />
        To validate a form these 3 questions are important:<br /><br />

        What kind of validation should I perform? You need to determine how to
        validate your data: string operations, type conversion, regular
        expressions, and so on. It's up to you.<br /><br />

        What should I do if the form doesn't validate? This is clearly a UI
        matter. You have to decide how the form will behave. Does the form send
        the data anyway? Should you highlight the fields that are in error?
        Should you display error messages?<br /><br />

        How can I help the user to correct invalid data? In order to reduce the
        user's frustration, it's very important to provide as much helpful
        information as possible in order to guide them in correcting their
        inputs. You should offer up-front suggestions so they know what's
        expected, as well as clear error messages. <br /><br />

      <h3>fetch() API</h3>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in the following
        significant ways:<br /><br />

        The Promise returned from fetch() won't reject on HTTP error status even
        if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, as soon as the server
        responds with headers, the Promise will resolve normally (with the ok
        property of the response set to false if the response isn't in the range
        200â€“299), and it will only reject on network failure or if anything
        prevented the request from completing.<br /><br />
        Unless fetch() is called with the credentials option set to include,
        fetch():<br /><br />
        won't send cookies in cross-origin requests<br /><br />
        won't set any cookies sent back in cross-origin responses<br /><br />
        As of August 2018, the default credentials policy changed to
        same-origin. Firefox was also modified in version 61.0b13)<br /><br />
        A basic fetch request is really simple to set up. Have a look at the
        following code:<br /><br />

        fetch('http://example.com/movies.json') .then((response) =>
        response.json()) .then((data) => console.log(data));
