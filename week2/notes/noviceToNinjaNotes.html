      <h3>Symbols</h3>

      <h3>isNaN()</h3>
      <p>
        Also Number.isNaN() and Number.inFinite are used to check if a value is
        a number.
      </p>

      <h3>Undefined & Null</h3>
      <p>
        Undefined is the value given to variables that have not been assigned a
        value. It can also occur if an object’s property doesn’t exist or a
        function has a missing parameter. It is basically JavaScript’s way of
        saying "I can’t find a value for this." Null Null means 'no value'. It
        can be thought of as a placeholder that JavaScript uses to say "there
        should be a value here, but there isn’t at the moment." If this reminds
        you a lot of undefined then this is because they are both 'non-value'
        values, meaning they are similar, but behave slightly differently. For
        example, if you try to do sums with them:
      </p>

      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>
        Arrays are an ordered list of values Multidimensional arrays are arrays
        that contain other arrays Arrays have lots of properties and methods
        that can be used to manipulate items in the array: .length, pop, push,
        shift, unshift, join, delete and merge. others are splice, slice, sort,
        reverse and .includes.
      </p>

      <h3>Sets</h3>
      <p>
        Sets are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of non-duplicate values.
        Methods and properties are; add, has, and delete. Do not froget the
        importance of WeakSetss

      <h3>Maps</h3>
      <p>
        Maps are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of key-value pairs. Map uses
        setters and getters.
        romanNumerals.set(2,'II').set(3,'III').set(4,'IV').set(5,'V'); Output is
        :Map { 1 => 'I', 2 => 'II', 3 => 'III', 4 => 'IV', 5 => 'V' }
      </p>

      <h3>Other Points</h3>
      <p>
        -The switch statement can be used instead of multiple if and else
        statements -A while loop and do ... while loop can be used to repeat a
        block of code while a condition is still true<br> -A for loop works in a
        similar way to a while loop, but has a different syntax<br> -A for-of loop
        can be used to iterate over an array<br> -Sets and maps are enumerable, so
        can also be looped over using a for-of loop.
