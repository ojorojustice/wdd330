      <h3>Canvas</h3>
      <p>
        Steps to painting a canvs is similar to real life.<br /><br />
        So 1. Get the element by id, where drawing is meant to be made 2. Get
        the context of drawing, like getting the platform<br /><br />
        3. Get the stroke fill and <br /><br />
        4. Get the brush style or color. and start drawing. <br /><br />
        5. There after, functions and addEventlisteners becomes important. var
        canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas"); <br />
        var context = canvas.getContext("2d"); <br />
        context.strokeStyle = "red";<br />
        context.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)";<br />
        context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100); <br />
        context.strokeRect(10, 10, 100, 100);<br />
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
      <p>
        Two ways to drag and drop are; 1 from the computer to the webpage and
        also from an element to another on the same page. There are several
        steps to adding drag and drop to my page:
        <br /><br />

        1. Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you’d like to be
        draggable.<br /><br />

        2. Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML
        elements.<br /><br />

        3. Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any
        elements that you want to have accept dropped items.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <h3>The DataTransfer Object</h3>
      <p>
        DataTransfer objects are one type of object outlined in the Drag and
        Drop API. These objects allow us to set and get data about the elements
        that are being dragged. Specifically, DataTransfer lets us define two
        pieces of information: <br /><br />

        1. the type of data we’re saving of the draggable element<br /><br />

        2. the value of the data itself<br /><br />

        We want to be able to store the ID of these images so that we know which
        image is being dragged around. To do this, we first tell DataTransfer
        that we want to save some plain text by passing in the string
        text/plain. Then we give it the ID of the image:
      </p>

      <h3>Further Reading</h3>
      <p>
        We’ve only touched on the basics of the Drag and Drop API, in order to
        give you a taste of what’s available. We’ve shown you how you can use
        DataTransfer to pass data from your dragged items to their drop targets.
        What you do with this power is up to you.<br /><br />

        To learn more about the Drag and Drop API, here are a couple of good
        resources:<br /><br />

        1. Mozilla Developer Network’s Drag and Drop documentation:
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API<br /><br />

        2. W3C’s Drag and Drop specification:
