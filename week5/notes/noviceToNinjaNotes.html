      <h3>Bugs</h3>
      <p>
        It is better to find bugs in a code early rather than trying to fix them
        later. I must consider all scenarios when writing my code to fix the
        errors that may come from the computers external infrastructures.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

      <p>
        JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use
        strict".This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.
      </p>

      <h3>Debbuging</h3>
      <p>
        In debugging and testing, important tools are;<br /><br />
        1. Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice
        and conventions. 2. Feature detection can check whether a method is
        supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.
        3. The console and browserâ€™s built-in debugging tool can be used to
        interactively find and fix bugs in code. Exceptions can be thrown using
        the throw statement. 4. Exception handling is very important as an error
        object is created when an exception occurs. Any code placed inside a try
        block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception
        occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or
        does not occur.
      </p>

      <h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
      <p>
        Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then
        writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every
        time a new feature is implemented. The Jest framework can be used to
        test my code.
