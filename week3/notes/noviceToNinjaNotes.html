      <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
      <p>
        >There are two ways to create a regular expression. The first, and
        preferred way, is to use the literal notation of writing the regular
        expression between forward slashes: <br /><br />

        const pattern = /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/;<br />

        Alternatively, you can create a new instance of the RegExp object using
        the new operator and a constructor function:<br /><br />

        const pattern = new RegExp('[a-zA-Z]+ing');<br />

        Using literal regular expressions takes less typing, but there are
        advantages to using the constructor function as it lets you create
        regular expressions using strings, which can be useful when the regular
        expression is provided from user input; in a form, for example.
        Constructors also have the advantage of letting us create a regular
        expression using a variable:<br /><br />

        const language = 'JavaScript';<br />
        const pattern = new RegExp(language);
      </p>
      <h3>Query Selector</h3>

      <p>
        The document.querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to
        find the first element in the document that matches that matches a CSS
        selector provided as an argument. If no elements match, it will return
        null. <br />

        The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but
        returns a node list of all the elements in the document that match the
        CSS query selector. If no elements match, it will return an empty node
        list.<br />

        These are both very powerful methods that can emulate all the methods
        discussed, as well as allowing more fine-grained control over which
        element nodes are returned.

      <h3>
        Keyboard Events (culled directly from the novice to ninja textbook)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Three events that occur when a user presses a key are: keydown, keypress
        and keyup. When a user presses a key, the events occur in that order.
        They are not tied to any particular key, although the information about
        which key was pressed is a property of the event object. <br /><br />The
        keydown event occurs when a key is pressed and will continue to occur if
        the key is held down. <br /><br />The keypress event occurs after a
        keydown event but before a keyup event. The keypress event only occurs
        for keys that produce character input (plus the 'Delete' key). This
        means that itâ€™s the most reliable way to find out the character that was
        pressed on the keyboard. <br /><br />The keyup event occurs when a key
        is released. To understand the differences in these events, it is
        important to distinguish between a physical key on the keyboard and a
        character that appears on the screen. The keydown event is the action of
        pressing a key, whereas the keypress event is the action of a character
        being typed on the screen.
