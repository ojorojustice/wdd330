        1. The first computer programs were written in machine code and assembly
        language. It is fast because it is close to the Computer architecture.
        Scripting languages are also high-level, but they are interpreted, which
        means they are translated into machine code at run time. JavaScript
        engines use a Just-In-Time (JIT) interpreting process, which
        considerably speeds up the compilation, making programs run faster.

        2. The first Browser War was about which type of javascript is running a
        browser and which is best. Microsoft won. The second is about which
        browser has the best engine is to interprete those javascript resources.

        3. Graceful Degradation is the process of building a website so it works
        best in a modern browser that uses JavaScript, but still works to a
        reasonable standard in older browsers, or if JavaScript or some of its
        features are unavailable. Progressive enhancement is the process of
        building a web page from the ground up with a base level of
        functionality, then adding extra enhancements if they are available in
        the browser.

        4. Javascript Values are created by typing in their name (true, null) or
        value (13, "abc"). You can combine and transform values with operators.
        Binary operators for arithmetic (+, -, *, /, and %), string
        concatenation (+), comparison (==, !=, ===, !==, <, >, <=, >=), and
        logic (&&, ||), - to negate a number, ! to negate logically, and typeof
        to find a valueâ€™s type) and a ternary operator (?:) to pick one of two
        values based on a third value.
