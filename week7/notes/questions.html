      <p>
        Need to really revisit the chapters that are related to functions, and
        object oriented programming. I need to master the use of the "this"
        keyword<br /><br />
        There is need also for me to repeat the todolist a third time and also
        implement the comment activity using the teachers solution as a guide.
        <br /><br />
        There is need for me to practice ajax and its many forms of sending and
        receiving data.
