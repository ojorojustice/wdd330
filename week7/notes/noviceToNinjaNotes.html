      <h3>Points From Ajax</h3>
      <p> Since Ajax is very important, It is important for me to memorise these steps.<br><br>
      const url = 'https:example.com/data';<br>
        const headers = new Headers({ 'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 'Accept-Charset' : 'utf-8', 'Accept-Encoding':'gzip,deflate' })<br>
        
        const request = (url,{<br>
            headers: headers<br>
        })<br>
        
        fetch(request)<br>
        .then( function(response) {<br>
            if(response.ok) {<br>
                return response;<br>
            }<br>
            throw Error(response.statusText);<br>
        })<br>
        .then( response => // do something with response )<br>
        .catch( error => console.log('There was an error!') )<br><br><br>

        The following points needs to be remembered.
      <ol>
        <li>1. Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data ususally asynchronously JSON-format data in the background.</li>
          
         <li> 2. Ajax is also used for communicating with external APIs.</li>
          
          <li>3. Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.</li>
          
      </ol></p><br><br>
      <h3>Further Functions Summary</h3>
      <p>
        I have to revisit and revisit Functions if I have to be trusted with javascript, these are the chapter summary points I need to review more before the end of the year.
<ol>
  <li>1. Because fucntions re super objects, they have built-in properties such as length, but can have custom properties added.

   <li>2. All functions have call() and apply() methods that can invoke a function with the value of this bound to an object that is provided as an argument.
  </li> 
  <li>3.  Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that are enclosed in parentheses and immediately followed by double parentheses so theyâ€™re invoked. They are useful for namespacing variables and setting default values.</li> 
    
   <li>4. Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors.</li> 
    
    <li>5. A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the function it was originally defined in.
    
      A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword.
      
      A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which returns the next value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.
    </li>
    
    <li>6. Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called from, have no side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same arguments (referential transparency). </li>
    
   <li>7. Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a function. A new function is returned until all the arguments have been used.</li>
</ol>
